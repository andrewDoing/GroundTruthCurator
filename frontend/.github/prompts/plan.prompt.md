Make a detailed plan to accomplish this. Think hardest.

How will we implement only the functionality we need right now?

Identify files that need to be changed.

Do not include plans for legacy fallback unless required or explicitly requested.

Keep it SIMPLE. We need initial working versions. Avoid over-engineering.

Write a short overview of what you are about to do.
Write function names and 1-3 sentences describing their purpose.
Write test names and 5-10 words about behavior to cover.

DO NOT edit any code!
